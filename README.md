I have rich experience in requirements interview, process management, engineering progress management, system architecture design, software function development (front-end, back-end and mobile terminal), cloud architecture and various cloud products, and overall processes. The development team that once managed 15+ began to design culture, development process, and automated infrastructure (DevOps) from 0.
